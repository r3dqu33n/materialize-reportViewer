# materialize-reportViewer
My humble attempt of providing a custom UI to the ASP.NET SSRS Report Viewer control.

### Why
This project was born as a result of several failed attempts to find some example of how to provide a custom GUI to the ASP.NET web control without headaches.

#### Remarks and/or Comments

**I'd like to remark the point that this repo is still empty, as this is a work still in progress. **

*Remark 2: This project has somewhat like a sort of hacks to the component and is using MaterializeCSS, but can be "easily" adapted to any kind of UI.*

*Remark 3: This is my first attempt of contribution to the open source community. Please don't hit me if you don't like this :D.*
